                Hello Everyone! My name is Pikachu. In this section you can pick-a-me.
                I was adopted by Ash Ketchum back in Palls. Realizing that I am way much
                smarter then some 10 years old I decided to leave him and go start my own
                web-tech company, and this is what my site is all about - so welcome,
                have fun, and please do not try to put me inside a pokeball, as I would not like that!

            <h3>What is the differnece between Web 1, Web 2 and Web 3?</h3>
            <p>Well, To answer that question lets explain each one of the Web versions:</p>
            <p>
                <u><b>Web 1:</b></u> One of the primary version of the web as we know it. In this version the web users had a limited intercation
                between them and the website itself. Also websites barley didn't have intercation with one another. Users could not post or
                comment feedbacks. Web 1 was a good way to let business let people know that they were out there and present information
                about their business.
            </p>
            <p>
                <u><b>Web 2:</b></u> In this version of the web users could interact with the website itself - they could comment, post and leave feedback.
                Web 2 encourged participation, collabration and information sharing from the web user. In this web version the users
                got introduced to website such as Facebook, Youtube and Wikipedia. Using Web 2 people could comminucate with each other
                and share experinces from their daily life. This version is the web as most people know it. People could now also
                search what they wanted to view using search engines. Another thing that charchertizes Web 2 is the web broswsers.
                Companies start to create web broswesers such as Internet Explorer, Google Chrome and many more.<br />
                In oppose to Web 1, which was considred to be an only "read" content, Web 2 is a "read-write" content.
            </p>
            <p>
                <u><b>Web 3:</b></u> So what else can we ask for that wans't implemented in Web 2? Web 3 is all about interperting information
                like human beings can. If we refred to Web 1 as "read" content and Web 2 as "read-write" content we can refer to web 3
                as a "read-write-execute" content. We want the machine to perform on it's own - the computer will act as if it is a
                personal assistant. The web 3 is the web version which we are using now-days.<br />
                Lets comapre between Web 2 and Web 3 using the following table:<br />
                <table class="paleBlueRows" style="height: 244px;" width="557">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>&nbsp;</th>
                            <th>Web 2</th>
                            <th>Web 3</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Communication</td>
                            <td>Interactive</td>
                            <td>Engaged</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Information</td>
                            <td>Dynamic</td>
                            <td>Personal</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Focus</td>
                            <td>Community</td>
                            <td>Individual</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Searching</td>
                            <td>Using keywords</td>
                            <td>Using relevance</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <br /><br />
            </p>
            <h3>Can you give an exmaple to show us the differnces between the web versions?</h3>
            <p>Well, no - I am just a Pokemon... but ok, I will try my best.</p>
            <p>
                Lets say you want to book an appointment to your hair dresser. In <strong>Web 1 </strong>you would only have the ability
                to view whatever your hair dresser decided to put on his website. He will probably will put up his phone number
                in the website and you will have to phone him in order to bool your appointment - bummers. Also, You'd have need
                to know his websites URL.
            </p>
            <p>
                In <strong>Web 2</strong>, You could search "Hair dresser" and after a few site searches you'd find his website. After you'd go on his website you could view
                his available meeting schedule and book an appointment yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                In <strong>Web 3</strong>, you will just ask your phone to make an appoitment for your hair dresser in a time
                that is convinet for you and your phone will do it and let you know if he had done it succefully or not -
                How amazing is that?!.
